    <p>What started small, with a single discount store and the simple idea of selling more for less, has grown over the
        last 50 years into the largest retailer in the world. Each week, over 265 million customers and members visit
        approximately 11,400 stores under 55 banners in 26 countries and eCommerce websites. With fiscal year 2020
        revenue of $524 billion, Walmart employs over 2.2 million associates worldwide. Walmart continues to be a leader
        in sustainability, corporate philanthropy and employment opportunity. It’s all part of our unwavering commitment
        to creating opportunities and bringing value to customers and communities around the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Every day low prices on a broad assortment - anytime, anywhere.</strong></p>
    <p>Every Day Low Price (EDLP) is the cornerstone of our strategy, and our price focus has never been stronger.
        Today's customer seeks the convenience of one-stop shopping that we offer. From grocery and entertainment to
        sporting goods and crafts, we provide the deep assortment that our customers appreciate — whether they're
        shopping online at Walmart.com, through one of our mobile apps or shopping in a store. We currently operate
        three primary store formats in the U.S., each custom tailored to its neighborhood. John Furner is Walmart U.S.
        President & CEO.</p>
    <p>Around the world, we help families save money so they can live better. We use our size and scale to provide
        access to high-quality goods and fresh, nutritious food at everyday low prices—while creating opportunities for
        our associates and small and medium-sized global suppliers.</p>
    <p>
        Led by President & CEO Judith McKenna, Walmart International has more than 5,900 retail units, operating outside
        the United States with 55 banners in 26 countries with more than 700,000 associates serving more than 100
        million customers every week. Read more about how we operate around the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Major innovations. Massive scale. Imagine the possibilities.</strong></p>
    <p>Did you know the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer is also one of the fastest growing and most dynamic
        e-commerce organizations? Led by Marc Lore, founder and former chief executive officer of Jet.com, we're
        creating an experience that lets customers shop anytime, anywhere — delivering exactly what they want, when they
        want it.</p>
    <p>Our largest website, Walmart.com, sees up to 100 million unique visitors a month, according to comScore, and is
        growing every year. With innovations like Online Grocery Pickup, NextDay shipping and a whole host of apps,
        we’re providing customers with more ways to save time and money while reimagining how digital and physical
        shopping work together.</p>
    <P>In 2016, Walmart acquired Jet.com and began expanding its portfolio of e-commerce sites. As part of the Jet
        acquisition, Hayneedle.com (home furnishings) also joined our family. Walmart acquired additional specialty
        e-tailers and digital brands over the next two years.</p>
<p>
        The result? An unparalleled selection of brands and categories, and a family of sites that provides a great
        end-to-end experience for customers.</P>
