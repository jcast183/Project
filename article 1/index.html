        <p><strong>Animal Welfare - Swine Assurance Position</strong></p>

        <p>At Walmart and Sam’s Club we are committed to providing our customers with safe, affordable, and sustainable
            food as well as promoting the humane treatment of animals. We seek continuous improvement in animal welfare
            practices within our fresh pork supply chain. As a result, in addition to our current programs, Walmart and
            Sam’s Club are launching a new tracking and audit program for our fresh pork supply. Every fresh pork
            supplier will be required to meet the new program requirements</p>
        <p>Walmart and Sam’s Club will continue to only accept fresh pork from animals raised under the standards of the
            National Pork Board’s (NPB’s) Pork Quality Assurance (PQA) Plus Program. Specific new tracking and audit
            requirements include:</p>

        <p> Each fresh pork supplier must have on-farm video monitoring for sow farms and will be subject to unannounced
            animal welfare video audits by an accredited and independent third-party.<br>
            - Implementation of video monitoring on sow farms must be complete on 20% of production supplied to Walmart
            and Sam’s Club on sow farms by the end of 2014, with another 20% of production added each year for the next
            4 years. This will result in 100% coverage by the end of 2018.<br>
            - Until all farms have video monitoring, an accredited and independent third-party will conduct annual
            on-site audits on farms without the technology. Farms will be given 72 hours notice.
            Each fresh pork supplier must implement an internal annual animal welfare audit for all farms that includes
            a grading system and corrective action tracking. This must occur at all farms.<br>
            - These audits must be done by PQA Plus-certified personnel and must include annual audits and probable
            abuse audits.<br>
            - These audits will be done with 72 hours notice.<br>
            - The supplier must retain records on the audit results, including the grade, corrective actions and PQA
            Plus certification number.
            Each supplier must make the documentation and results of the tracking and audit program available to Walmart
            as requested, but not less than twice annually. </p>

        <p><strong>Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. Position</strong></p>
        <p>We recognize that farm animals play an important role in providing nutritious meat, dairy and eggs to our
            customers and members. We believe that farm animals in our supply chain should be treated humanely
            throughout their lives and that the welfare of farm animals should be considered in selection of all
            production systems, practices and technologies. Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. are committed to continuous
            improvement in the welfare of farm animals in our supply chain.</p>
        <p>First, we expect that our suppliers will not tolerate animal abuse of any kind.</p>

        <p>Second, we support the globally-recognized “Five Freedoms1” of animal welfare as an aspiration for animal
            welfare in our supply chain:</p>

        <p>Freedom from Hunger and Thirst – by providing ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health
            and vigor.<br>
            Freedom from Discomfort – by providing appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting
            area.<br>
            Freedom from Pain, Injury or Disease – by ensuring prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment.<br>
            Freedom to Express Normal Behavior – by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the
            animal’s own kind.<br>
            Freedom from Fear and Distress – by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering.<br>
            Third, we will work with our supply chain</p>

        <h4>Human Rights Statement</h4>
        <p> <strong>Our Business and Values</strong>
            Walmart’s purpose is to save people money and help them live better. We achieve our purpose through our
            associates and recognize that our associates make the difference. Through our business, we provide customers
            with convenient access to safe, affordable products and services; contribute to the community; create career
            opportunities; and provide opportunities for suppliers to grow their businesses that, in turn, employ others
        </p>
        <p>We engage in diverse business activities across the globe, with more than two million full-time and part-time
            associates from a variety of ethnicities, orientations, backgrounds and life experiences. Our associates
            also are members of thousands of local communities around the world. We endeavor to act in an ethical and
            responsible manner and have policies and procedures in place to guide our decisions and behaviors.</p>
        <p>Our associate base is large, our supply chain reaches thousands of suppliers and we serve millions of
            customers in communities around the world through our store presence as well as online. We are mindful that
            many adverse human rights risks are complex and can be the result of systemic issues, making it challenging
            for any single organization to have an impact. When it comes to addressing these human rights issues, we
            seek to go beyond our own policies and procedures by working collaboratively with other stakeholders to
            inform our approach and identify root causes; sharing our work with others; and using our leverage to help
            drive positive change.</p>
