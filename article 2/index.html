        <p><strong>Standards for Suppliers</strong></p>
        <p>All suppliers and their facilities – including subcontracting and packaging facilities – are expected to
            uphold Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers. Learn more about our standards and expectations for suppliers and
            our requirements for facility disclosure here.</p>

        <p><strong>Sustainable Chemistry Commitment</strong></p>



        <p>Walmart customers expect products that are safe, affordable and sustainable. Sustainable Chemistry is the
            design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous
            substances, both to humans and the environment. To minimize the negative environmental and social impact,
            Walmart has developed a policy on sustainable chemistry for its consumables/Health & Wellness business that
            focuses on transparency, advancing formulation, and begin labeling private brand products in accordance with
            the U.S. EPA’s Design for the Environment Safer Product Labeling.</p>
        <p>Beginning in January 2015, Walmart expects all suppliers will provide full online public ingredient
            disclosure for formulated consumable items sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club. For private brands, Walmart
            partnered with the WERCs – a vendor supporting Walmart’s chemical safety and regulatory compliance – to
            house all proprietary product formulations. Supplier formulations remain confidential from Walmart. Through
            the WERCS, Walmart private brand suppliers reviewed and approved their in-scope products ingredients in
            compliance with either U.S. EPA's Design for the Environment Standard for Safer Products or CSPA's Consumer
            Product Ingredient Communication Initiative. Ingredient information for Walmart private brand products
            within the scope of the policy will be made available on Walmart.com and Samsclub.com items pages.</p>
        <p>The following categories of ingredients are commonly protected as trade secrets. When ingredients in these
            categories are trade secrets, they should be disclosed as follows: Dyes and colorants: should be listed by a
            chemical-descriptive name. In some cases, Walmart’s private brand products may list colorants that vary by
            product. Fragrances: Scent ingredients may be listed as "Fragrance," on the label, but the formulator must
            indicate where detailed information can be found. View Walmart’s Fragrance palette for private brands.</p>
        <p>The Walmart Sustainability Index will measure supplier compliance with the policy. If a formulated consumable
            product is missing its online ingredient disclosure, please email sustainabilityassessment@wal-mart.com.</p>
        <p><strong>Walmart Statement of Ethics</strong></p>

        <p>Global Ethics is responsible for promoting Walmart’s culture of integrity. This includes developing and
            upholding our policies for ethical behavior for all of our stakeholders everywhere we operate.</p>
